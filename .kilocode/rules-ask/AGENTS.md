**See main [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) for complete project rules, build commands, and coding standards.**

## Ask Mode Specifics

When answering questions or explaining code:

- Reference specific files with relative paths
- Point to relevant docs in [`documentation-md/architecture/`](../../documentation-md/architecture/)
- Code lives in `wxt-version/`, documentation in project root
