  <h1>AI and Human Collaboration</h1>
  <p>
    Artificial intelligence continues to reshape how humans work, communicate,
    and make decisions. Collaboration between people and intelligent systems is
    rapidly becoming the default mode in many industries.
  </p>

  <!-- Broken: H1 → H4 (skips H2, H3) -->
  <h4>Interface-Level Decision Nudging</h4>
  <p>
    User interfaces powered by AI often influence decisions subtly, guiding
    people toward recommended actions without explicit instruction.
  </p>

  <!-- Backward jump: H4 → H2 -->
  <h2>Managing Automation Bias</h2>
  <p>
    Automation bias occurs when users rely too heavily on AI suggestions,
    especially when the models appear confident or authoritative.
  </p>

  <!-- Forward jump skipping H3: H2 → H4 -->
  <h4>Consequences of Over-Trust</h4>
  <p>
    Excessive trust in AI systems can lead to overlooked risks, particularly
    in areas like aviation, healthcare, and autonomous vehicle navigation.
  </p>

  <!-- Backward jump: H4 → H3 -->
  <h3>Explainability Challenges</h3>
  <p>
    Even when explanations are provided, they can be incomplete or simplified,
    leaving users with a false sense of clarity about how decisions are made.
  </p>

  <!-- Normal jump: H3 → H4 -->
  <h4>Hidden Model Limitations</h4>
  <p>
    Many AI models rely on hidden assumptions about data quality and environmental
    stability. When these assumptions break, performance may silently degrade.
  </p>

  <!-- Extreme backward jump: H4 → H1 -->
  <h1>Re-Evaluating AI Oversight</h1>
  <p>
    Oversight frameworks must evolve in parallel with AI capabilities.
    Human review, transparency tools, and robust testing environments are
    essential to avoid blind reliance on automated systems.
